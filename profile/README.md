We're a small team of engineers and researchers who want to streamline the process of teaching robots how to better interact with us! 
Our north star is to build a firmware-agnostic platform enabling users to define action spaces, constraints, and expected behaviour for any robotic system.

Here are some cool papers that inspired us:
