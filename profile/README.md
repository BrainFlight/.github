## Welcome to BrainFlight 
We're a small team of engineers and researchers who want to streamline the process of teaching robots how to better interact with us! 
Our north star is to build a firmware-agnostic platform enabling users to define constraints and action spaces for any robotic system.

Here are some cool papers that inspired us:
- <a href="https://openvla.github.io/">OpenVLA</a>
- <a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/rt-2-new-model-translates-vision-and-language-into-action/">DeepMind RT-2</a>
- <a href="https://octo-models.github.io/">🐙 Octo</a>
